# Spaceship-Float
Spaceship Float (temporary name) is a game currently under active development. Players control a plane that floats or flies upwards when the screen is held down, tilting to navigate like a regular plane. Upon releasing the screen, the plane adjusts downward. The goal is to avoid asteroids that consistently spawn within a specific radius. Exciting updates are in progress!
